## Verification questions

1. When an error occurs while trying to save a score to a file (for example,
   choosing a file in a read-only system directory), what is the message that is
   shown in your error dialog?  (note: answers will vary depending on your
   operating system).

   Answer: "java.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\Users\fishe\Desktop\a5\scores.txt (Access is denied)"

## Reflection questions

1. Which of the Swing tutorial pages did you find the most interesting and/or
   helpful while implementing your graphical application?

   Answer: We found the MouseEvent page to be not just most helpful in implementing our
   graphical application, but also the most interesting. It is quite helpful to know all
   of the ways in which we can make a graphical application responsive to the user. Given
   the many ways to direct how the user can interact with some application like ours, there
   are seemingly endless possibilities and features that can be implemented. Especially since
   Swing applications by comparison to something like web applications (JavaScript, HTML/CSS),
   it is amazing how, noting that Swing has been around for quite some time and is relatively
   archaic to some modern web applications, there is so much responsive potential in Swing
   graphical applications.

2. Are you aware of any areas where your submission is not working as intended?
   If so, describe the issue and what you did to try to diagnose it.  Otherwise,
   describe how you verified that your submission fulfilled its requirements.

   We found that our submission is working quite well. We tested our application against
   the basic requirements included on the A5 handout and although not perfect at first,
   we found some issues and adjusted our application so that they met the requirements.

3. Did you embellish your program in any way?  If so, describe your changes /
   improvements.

   N/A. We both found ourselves quite busy the past two weeks and therefore did not have ample
   time to embellish our program. Given some more time, we would have enjoyed having a high score
   record and perhaps including some pre-defined "levels of diffculty" as some games, such as
   Minecraft, have multiple (discrete) difficulties (Peaceful, Easy, Normal, Hard, Hardcore).
